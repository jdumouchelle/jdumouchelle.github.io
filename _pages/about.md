I will join the University of Calgary as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics later this year.  


I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Elias Khalil](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/khalil/).  I completed my MASc in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/) at Polytechnique Montr√©al and my BMath in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization from the University of Waterloo.
I worked in industry for one year as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.rbcborealis.com/) on applied machine learning projects.


### Research Interests
Operations research, discrete optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and machine learning.


### Research
My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. I am focused on developing efficient data-driven algorithms for complex decision-making problems, particularly in settings involving uncertainty (stochastic programming and robust optimization) and multiple decision-makers (bilevel optimization), with logistics, transportation, and healthcare applications.



 **I will be recruiting Master's and Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2026. Please reach out with your CV by email if interested.**
