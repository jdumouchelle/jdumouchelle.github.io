I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Elias Khalil](https://ekhalil.com/).  My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and operations research.  I am currently focusing on the development of data-driven algorithms for discrete optimization, stochastic programming, and robust optimization.  
 
 
I completed my MASc in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/) at Polytechnique Montréal and my BMath in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization from the University of Waterloo. Before my Master's I worked for one year as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/) on projects related to NLP and time series prediction.
