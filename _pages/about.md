I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Elias Khalil](https://ekhalil.com/).  I completed my MASc in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/) at Polytechnique Montr√©al and my BMath in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization from the University of Waterloo. Before my Master's, I worked for one year as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/) on NLP and time series prediction projects.

 
### Research
My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. My PhD research has focused on the development of data-driven algorithms to address complex discrete optimization problems. Specifically, I have developed efficient data-driven algorithms to address challenging optimization problems in stochastic programming, robust optimization, and bilevel optimization, with applications in domains such as logistics, transportation, and healthcare.
