I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics.  My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. I am focused on developing efficient data-driven algorithms for complex decision-making problems, particularly in settings involving discrete decisions, uncertainty, and multiple decision-makers, with applications in logistics, transportation, and healthcare.




<!-- ## Bio -->
I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Elias Khalil](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/khalil/).  I completed my MASc in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/) at Polytechnique Montr√©al and my BMath in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization from the University of Waterloo.
I worked in industry for one year as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.rbcborealis.com/) on applied machine learning projects.



<!-- ### Research Interests -->
**Research Areas**: Operations Research, Integer Programming, Stochastic Programming, Robust Optimization, Optimization Under Uncertainty,  Machine Learning

**Prospective Students**: I am recruiting Master's and Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2026. Please reach out with your CV and transcripts by email if interested.
